## DataVis Makeover

Remaking a peer’s original design by improving the clarity and aesthetics of charts and/or by creating an alternative design if needed.
:::

# 1. The Task

In this take-home exercise, we are required to:

-   select one of the Take-home Exercise 1 prepared by our classmates,

-   critique the submission in terms of clarity and aesthetics,

-   prepare a sketch for the alternative design by using the data visualization design principles and best practices we have learned in Lesson 1 and 2, and

-   remake the original design by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.

# 2. Data Preparation

I will follow the data preparation steps done by the original author of the selector graphs. The steps are listed below for easy reference. As this is not the focus of the exercise, I will not go into the minute details of preparation.

## 2.1 Loading R packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggrepel, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, patchwork, intsvy, ggdist, ggridges,colorspace, plotly)
```

## 2.2 Importing the Data set

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- 
  read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

## 2.3 Removing missing values and Converting data types

Rows with missing values for ESCS were removed before further analysis.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean <- stu_qqq_SG[complete.cases(stu_qqq_SG[, "ESCS"]), ]
```

CNTSCHID and CNTSTUID's data types were changed to character.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSCHID <- as.character(stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSCHID)
stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSTUID <- as.character(stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSTUID)
```

## 2.4 Binning Variable ESCS

The ESCS variable was binned into quantiles using the [mutate()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) and [cut()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut) function

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean <- stu_qqq_SG_clean %>%
  mutate(ESCS_recoded = cut(ESCS,breaks=quantile(ESCS,c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1)),labels=c("Very Low","Low","Medium","High"),include.lowest=TRUE))
```

## 2.5 Recoding ST004D01T (Gender) variable

Variable ST004D01T, was recoded to labels to “Female” and “Male” respectively.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean$ST004D01T <- recode(stu_qqq_SG_clean$ST004D01T, "1" = "Female", "2" = "Male")
```

# 3. Visualization Critique and Remake

The graphs created by the author will be reviewed and improved in terms of clarity and aesthetics.

## 3.1 General distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading

The author had created a data folder path to save any data files generated:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

data_folder_path <- file.path(getwd(), "data")
```

The code below is used to determine the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values across the population of students that took the assessment, and merge the values via a [rbind()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html) function (with a [relocate()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/relocate.html) function to bring the newly formed “subject” column to the front of the dataframe) to form a table indicating the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values per subject

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathgeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmath_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvmathgeneral$subject <- "Math"

pvreadgeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvread_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadgeneral$subject <- "Reading"

pvsciegeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscie_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvsciegeneral$subject <- "Science"

mergedgeneral <- rbind(pvmathgeneral,pvreadgeneral,pvsciegeneral)
mergedgeneral %>% relocate(subject)
```

The graphical representation of the general distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores was generated using the code below.

::: panel-tabset
## The original plot

## The code

```{r}
#| eval: false

p1<- ggplot(mergedgeneral, aes(x = subject, y = Mean,colour=subject)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),lwd=0.5,show.legend=FALSE) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point",
    shape = 18,
    size = 5,
    aes(colour=subject),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    width = 0.5,
    size=0.8,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Scores across Math, Reading and Science across all 15-year olds who took PISA 2022 in SGP") +
  ylab("Scores") +
  xlab("Subject")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 50))+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
p1
```
:::

### 3.1.1 Clarity

The author had concluded that "15-year olds in Singapore performed best in Math, followed by Science and lastly Reading". We can see this somewhat clearly in the graph.

The author had labelled this visualization as "General distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading", however the graph seem to show a range of scores across the 3 subjects.

From the original code, the author had initiated a series of box plots across the 3 subjects to represent the mean scores across.

However, upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    #width = 0.5,
    #size=0.8,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
```

Therefore I would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean subject scores across subjects.

Examining the subset used for the plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(mergedgeneral)
```

The *mergedgeneral* subset table only has 3 observations out of 6 variables.

Therefore I would conclude that the code used is not able to plot a **Distribution** of student scores across subjects and that this EDA should be re-labelled as the "Overall mean scores across Math, Reading and Science", instead.

### 3.1.2 Aesthetics

-   The use of colors to represent each subject helps identify each subject clearly.

-   Legend or Axis labels:- As there is already a legend on the right which identifies subjects by colour, the Y axis labels seem redundant.

-   The manual setting of the axis via the code below could be further refined and shortened. Because of the large scale, the graph appears too elongated.

```{r}
#| eval: false
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 50))
```

-   The author could instead annotate the mean, max and min scores. This would enable us to remove the background grid lines and would make the X axis tick marks unnecessary. Even with the background grid lines and X axis tick marks, I am unable to decipher the actual mean, max and min scores clearly.

-   The X axis should stop at zero, as there are no negative scores.

-   Since Math, Reading and Science are clearly labelled in the Y axis, the label "Subject" can be removed.

### 3.1.3 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

### 3.1.4 Remake

We have established that the original plot is unable to exhibit the distribution of student scores across subjects.

First, I will use the code below to extract data from the original data set to get our reference lines (mean and median.

In terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which are available for all students.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

mean_pv1math <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1MATH)
median_pv1math <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1MATH)
mean_pv1read <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1READ)
median_pv1read <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1READ)
mean_pv1scie <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1SCIE)
median_pv1scie <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1SCIE)

```

Next, I will use the code below to re-make the original graph into Histograms with Density plots for each subject.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

p_1 <- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1MATH)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 20, color = "black", fill='lightblue') +
  geom_density(color = "purple") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(x = "Math Scores", y = "Density") + # Change label to 'Density'
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_pv1math, color = 'black', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = mean_pv1math, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Mean:", round(mean_pv1math, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "black", hjust = 1.5, size = 3
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_pv1math, color = 'red', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = median_pv1math, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Median:", round(median_pv1math, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "red", hjust = -0.45, size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

p_2 <- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1READ)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 20, color = "black", fill='lightgreen') +
  geom_density(color = "purple") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(x = "Reading Scores", y = "Density") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_pv1read, color = 'black', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = mean_pv1read, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Mean:", round(mean_pv1read, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "black", hjust = 1.5, size = 3
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_pv1read, color = 'red', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = median_pv1read, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Median:", round(median_pv1read, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "red", hjust = -0.45, size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

p_3 <- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1SCIE)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 20, color = "black", fill='lightpink') +
  geom_density(color = "purple") +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(x = "Science Scores", y = "Density") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_pv1scie, color = 'black', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = mean_pv1scie, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Mean:", round(mean_pv1scie, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "black", hjust = 1.5, size = 3
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_pv1scie, color = 'red', size = 0.65, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = median_pv1scie, y = 0.0025, label = paste("Median:", round(median_pv1scie, 2))), # Adjust y position for text
    color = "red", hjust = -0.45, size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

p_4 <- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = "Math")) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_density(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1READ, fill = "Reading"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_density(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1SCIE, fill = "Science"), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Combined Scores",
       y = "Density") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Math" = "lightblue", "Reading" = "lightgreen", "Science" = "lightpink")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +  # Remove the legend
  theme_minimal()

```

Finally, using the code below, I will create a composite graph for all the histograms and density plots using the code below.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

patch1 <- (p_1 + p_2) / (p_3 + p_4)  + 
              plot_annotation(
                title = "Distribution of student performance in Math, Reading and Science",
                subtitle = "All subjects exihibit a slight left-skewed distribution" )

patch1 & theme( axis.text.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),)
```

## 3.2 Distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading across school

The author has used the [pisa.mean.pv](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [intsvy](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy) package, to obtain the composite Mean and Standard Deviation values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” for each school.

The code below generates the composite PV values.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathsch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmath_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadsch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvread_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)

pvsciesch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscie_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)
```

The author then generated individual plots to display the distribution of mean Math, Reading and Science scores across schools.

The code chunks are as follows:

::: panel-tabset

## The code

```{r}
#| eval: false

p2<- ggplot(pvmathsch, aes(x = as.factor(CNTSCHID), y = Mean)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),lwd=1.5) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point",
    shape = 18,
    size = 5,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),
    color = "red"
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    width = 0.8,
    size=1,
    position = position_dodge(width = 10)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Math Scores by School") +
  ylab("Math Score") +
  xlab("School ID")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000),breaks = seq(0, 1000, by=100))+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size=20)             
```
:::

### 3.2.1 Clarity

From the original code, the author had initiated a series of box plots across the 3 subjects to represent the mean scores by each school id (164 schools).

The author had concluded that the plot indicated that "*most schools have PV scores ranging from 400 to 700 in Math, Reading, and Science*".

The author also identified that School IDs 70200149 and 70200115 "*showed lower scores in Math, Reading, and Science compared to other schools*". And that schools IDs 70200001 and 70200002 "*consistently performed better in all three segments*".

Initially I had interpreted this visualization to represent the range of student scores for all subjects per school (Max, min and mean scores). This is because of the author's conclusion above and the use of the title "Math/Reading/Science scores by school".

However, upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    #width = 0.8,
    #size=1,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 10)

```

Therefore I would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean scores across different schools.

Examining the subset used for the plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(head(pvmathsch))
```

The data set has been grouped by School ID and contains variables like Frequency ( number of students, per school) and the overall mean score per school ID. Hence I would conclude that this subset is not able to plot the range of scores per school, and can only be used to display the mean scores per school ID.

While this subset and plot can be useful to help analyse the disparity in the performance between schools, I think that the visualization can be remade into a simpler version to enable the reader to quickly identify the disparity in school performance.

### 3.2.2 Aesthetics

-   The use of a vertically long graph to compare the means across school IDs is useful to identify the rough range of mean scores overall, but it is visually difficult to quickly identify the schools with the top and bottom mean scores.

-   The title of the graphs are misleading and should be re-labelled to "Mean Scores" instead.

-   Since the graphs are already well labelled, and identifies the different subjects clearly, the use of different colors per subject would not be necessary.

-   Since there are 164 schools, the use of a vertically long format makes it difficult to read the Y-axis labels.

-   Since the school ids in the Y-axis are sequenced the same, it would be sufficient to only label the Y-axis one time only.

### 3.2.3 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

### 3.2.4 Remake

We have established that the original plot, while useful to identify the differences in school performance, does not enable to reader to quickly capture the information from the data points.

Therefore, I will use the same data set used by the author but design a new graph to improve on the original intention.

I will use the code below to re-make the original graph into Bubble plots for each subject. For this remake, I have kept things simple, and just used color as a means to differentiate the mean scores.

I have also added reference lines to show the 10th and 90th percentile scores to easily identify the schools in those two opposite categories.

Lastly, I have also added annotations to quickly identify the top 5 and bottom 5 schools with the best and worst mean scores.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(ggrepel)

# Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 schools
top_5 <- pvmathsch %>% 
  arrange(desc(Mean)) %>%
  slice(1:5)

bottom_5 <- pvmathsch %>% 
  arrange(Mean) %>%
  slice(1:5)

# Base plot with points colored by the mean score
p1 <- ggplot(pvmathsch, aes(x = CNTSCHID, y = Mean)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Mean), alpha = 0.5, size = 7) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "green") +
  labs(title = "Mean Math Scores per School",
       subtitle = "5 Schools with the Best & Worst mean scores",
       x = "School ID",
       y = "Mean Math Scores") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # Remove minor grid lines

# Annotate the top 5 and bottom 5 schools
p1 <- p1 +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = top_5, 
    aes(label = CNTSCHID, y = Mean), 
    color = "blue", 
    size = 3, 
    nudge_y = 12,   # Adjust nudge_y if necessary to move text up or down
    direction = "y"
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = bottom_5, 
    aes(label = CNTSCHID, y = Mean), 
    color = "blue", 
    size = 3, 
    nudge_y = -12,  # Adjust nudge_y if necessary to move text up or down
    direction = "y"
  )

# Calculate the 10th and 90th percentiles
percentile10 <- quantile(pvmathsch$Mean, probs = 0.10, na.rm = TRUE)
percentile90 <- quantile(pvmathsch$Mean, probs = 0.90, na.rm = TRUE)

# Add horizontal lines for the 10th and 90th percentiles to your plot
p1 <- p1 + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = percentile10, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue", size = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = percentile90, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue", size = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = percentile10, label = paste("10th Percentile:", round(percentile10, 2))), 
            hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0, color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = percentile90, label = paste("90th Percentile:", round(percentile90, 2))), 
            hjust = 1.05, vjust = 1, color = "blue", size = 3)

p1

```

Lastly, for interactivity, we can also use `ggplotly()` to convert this to an interactive graph. With the added interactivity, the reader can use the tooltip function to gain more information on the specific data points.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(plotly)

# Convert to an interactive plot
ggplotly(p1, tooltip = c("x", "y"))
```

::: callout-note
## Note

Some of the previous annotations generated in the static plot may not appear after turning it into an interactive plot. Hence, we can use both static and interactive plots together if needed. For example, static charts to quickly summarize and communication information to reader, and an interactive charts for readers to drill down in more detail, eg zooming to certain segments, identifying specific data point details etc.

## 3.3 Distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading by gender

The author had used the [pisa.mean.pv](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [intsvy](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy) package to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” for each gender.

The code below was used to generate the composite PV values for Math, Reading and Science by gender.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

### 3.3.1 Clarity

From the original code, the author had initiated a series of box plots across the 3 subjects to represent the mean scores by gender.

The author had concluded that the plots indicated that "*males are observed to perform slightly better in Math and Science, whereas females are slightly stronger in Reading*".

Initially I had interpreted this visualization to represent the range of student scores for all subjects per gender (Max, min and mean scores). This is because of the author's conclusion above and the use of the title "Math/Reading/Science scores by Gender".

However, upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```

Therefore I would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean subject scores across different genders.

Examining the subset used for the plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(pvmathgenderonly)
```

The data set segregates the different genders and their mean scores. Hence I would conclude that this subset is not able to plot the range of scores per gender, and can only be used to compare the mean scores for genders across the 3 subjects.

While this subset and plot can be useful to help compare the mean subject scores between genders, I think that the visualization can done differently to enable the reader to obtain more information in the performance between genders.

### 3.3.2 Aesthetics

-   The title of the graphs are misleading and should be re-labelled to "Mean Scores" instead.

-   Since the graphs are already well labelled in the x and y axis, and identifies the different genders clearly, the use of different colors per gender and the legend would not be necessary.

-   Y axis title "Gender" is not necessary, as "males" and "females" are already labelled.

-   The author could instead annotate the mean scores. This would enable us to remove the background grid lines and would make the X axis tick marks unnecessary. Even with the background grid lines and X axis tick marks, I am unable to decipher the actual mean scores clearly.

### 3.3.3 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

### 3.3.4 Remake

We have established that the original plot is unable to exhibit the full range of subject scores across genders.

Therefore, I will extract data from the original data set to create new subsets for the new plots using the code below.

In terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which are available for all students.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Create a subset of the data with gender and PV1 score columns
subset_gender_PV1 <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  select(ST004D01T, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)

# Convert the "ST004D01T" column to a factor 
subset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T <- factor(subset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Female", "Male"))

Math_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1MATH, removing NA values
  )

Read_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1READ, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1READ, removing NA values
  )

SCIE_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1SCIE, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1SCIE, removing NA values
  )
```

Next, I will use the code below to create new box plots for each subject.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"


# Create the plot using the subset_data
bxp1 <- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1000)) +
  geom_point(data = Math_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean), color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(data = Math_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean, label = round(Mean, 2)), 
            color = "black", vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +
  labs(x = "Math",
       y = "Scores") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "lightblue", "Male" = "lightblue")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove the legend


bxp2 <- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = PV1READ, fill = ST004D01T)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1000)) +
  geom_point(data = Read_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean), color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(data = Read_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean, label = round(Mean, 2)), 
            color = "black", vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +
  labs(x = "Reading",
       y = "Scores") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightgreen", "lightgreen")) +  # Associate colors with factor levels
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove the legend

bxp3 <- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = PV1SCIE, fill = ST004D01T)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1000)) +
  geom_point(data = SCIE_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean), color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(data = SCIE_gender, aes(x = ST004D01T, y = Mean, label = round(Mean, 2)), 
            color = "black", vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +
  labs(x = "Science",
       y = "Scores") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink", "lightpink")) +  # Associate colors with factor levels
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove the legend
```

I will use the code below to create a composite graph.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

patch3 <- bxp1 + bxp2 + bxp3 + 
              plot_annotation(
                title = "Male students outperform in Maths and Science",
                subtitle = "Female students outperform in Reading")

patch3 & theme( axis.text.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),)
```

## 3.4 Distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores by socioeconomic status

The author had previously created a new variable, “ESCS_recoded”, which bins the socio-economic (ESCS) score into four quantiles - “Very Low”, “Low”, “Medium” and “High”. The author had used the [pisa.mean.pv](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [intsvy](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy) package to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” and grouped by the ESCS.

The code below was used to generate the composite PV values for Math, Reading and Science.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmathescs",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvreadescs",folder=data_folder_path)

pvscieescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscieescs",folder=data_folder_path)
```

The author then used the below code to generate individual plots to display the distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores across schools by socioeconomic status.

  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point",
    shape = 10,
    size = 2,
    aes(colour=ESCS_recoded),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ESCS_recoded),
    width = 0.5,
    size=1,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Science Scores by Socioeconomic Status") +
  ylab("Science Score") +
  xlab("Socioeconomic Status")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000),breaks = seq(0, 1000, by=200))+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size=10)

### 3.4.1 Clarity

From the original code, the author had initiated a series of box plots across the 3 subjects to represent the mean scores by the 4 quantiles of the ESCS score.

The author had concluded that the plots indicated that *"students with higher socioeconomic statuses perform better than peers with lower socioeconomic statuses in all three subjects".*

Initially I had interpreted this visualization to represent the range of student scores for all subjects per economic status (ESCS score). This is because of the author’s conclusion above and the use of the title “Math/Reading/Science scores by Socioeconomic status”.

However, upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ESCS_recoded),
    #width = 0.5,
    #size=1,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
```

Therefore I would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean subject scores across different groupings of ESCS score.

Examining the subset used for the plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(pvscieescs)
```

The data set segregates the 4 different ESCS quantiles and their mean scores. Hence I would conclude that this subset is not able to plot the range of scores per ESCS segment, and can only be used to compare the mean scores across the 4 quantiles.

While this subset and plots can be useful to help compare the mean subject scores between the different ESCS quantiles, I think that a different set of data and visualization can be used to communicate more information about the relationship between subject scores and socioeconomic statuses.

Additionally, the **binning** of the ESCS score, while helpful to identify disparities between students of different socioeconomic segment, may itself be limited in usefulness, for the following reasons:-

-   Binning the ESCS scores adds in an element of subjectivity. For example, why should there be 4 segments of socioeconomic statuses instead of 3, or 6?

-   Upon deciding the number of socioeconomic segments, is it truly applicable for all countries? For example, would a "Low segment" in Singapore be equivalent to a "Low segment" in a country in Sub-Saharan Africa?

### 3.4.2 Aesthetics

-   The title of the graphs are misleading and should be re-labelled to “Mean Scores” instead.

-   Since the graphs are already well labelled in the x and y axis, and identifies the different socioeconomic segments clearly, the use of different colors per segment and the legend would not be necessary.

-   The author could instead annotate the mean scores. This would enable us to remove the background grid lines and would make the X axis tick marks unnecessary. Even with the background grid lines and X axis tick marks, I am unable to decipher the actual mean scores clearly.

### 3.4.3 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

### 3.4.4 Remake

As mentioned, I would prefer not to bin the ESCS scores. Therefore I will use scatter plots to communicate the relationships between the ESCS score and subject scores.

Drawing inspiration from Prof Kam's [Lesson 3](https://isss608-ay2023-24jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson03_outline) and well as additional useful references, I will proceed to plot [Scatter plots with Marginal Histograms.](https://things-about-r.tumblr.com/post/124004085689/scatter-plots-with-marginal-densities-an-example)

In terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which are available for all students.

For this visualization, I will use the [ggstatplot package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggstatsplot/index.html). [@patil2021]

For more information on this package and how it can be used to create graphics from statistical tests included in the plots themselves, please [refer to this link.](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03167)

```{r}
library(ggstatsplot)
```

Creating new data subset for visualization.

```{r}
subset_ESCS_PV1 <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  select(ESCS, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)

#omiting NA values
subset_ESCS_PV1 <- na.omit(subset_ESCS_PV1)
```

We will use the code below from `ggstatplot package` to generate the plot.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ggscatterstats(
  data = subset_ESCS_PV1,                                          
  x = ESCS,                                                  
  y = PV1MATH,
  xlab = "Socioeconomic score (ESCS)",
  ylab = "Math scores",
  marginal = TRUE,
  marginal.type = "histogram",
  centrality.para = "mean",
  margins = "both",
  title = "Relationship between Socio-economic and Math scores",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

The benefit of this plot is that it shows both the correlation between the two variables as well as their respective distributions, and includes important statictics like the Pearson coefficient.

From the plot above, the pearson coefficient of 0.42 indicates that there is a weak positive relationship between ESCS scores and Math scores. Math scores resemble a normal distribution, while ESCS scores resemble a left-skewed distribution.
